# malnutrition_in_the_world
This repository contains a descriptive analysis of global malnutrition using Python, utilizing data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.

The analysis explores the prevalence, causes, and impacts of malnutrition worldwide, with a focus on key indicators such as undernourishment, stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies. It aims to provide insights into the severity of malnutrition in different regions, identify patterns and trends, and highlight the urgency of addressing this critical global issue.

The Python scripts included in this repository utilize data processing techniques, statistical analysis, and visualization libraries to extract meaningful information from the FAO dataset. The code provides a reproducible workflow for conducting the descriptive analysis and can serve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of nutrition and public health.

By sharing this repository, we hope to raise awareness about the global malnutrition crisis and encourage collaboration and innovation in finding effective solutions. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome from researchers, data scientists, and anyone interested in addressing the complex challenge of malnutrition.

Let's work together to fight malnutrition and improve the well-being of people around the world.
